              <strong>Search Tips</strong><br />
              Below are a few tips for using the search.
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Literal vs. Fuzzy</strong><br />
              The search algorithm does it's best to decide what you want.<br />
              It does this based on a few factors some of which include frequency, order and placement.<br />
              For some searches, this may not be what you want.<br />
              If you know a phrase you are looking for, you can surround your search term in quotes, like the following:<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">"notice of availability"</div><br />
              This also enables you to search literally for special characters listed below.<br />
              If you'd like to search for a code section like "1985.3(g)", just search the following<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">"1985.3(g)"</div><br />
              (The inherent problem with the search above without "" is that it contains parenthesis)
              <br /><br />

              <strong>OR and AND</strong><br />
              When searching, the algorithm picks words specified in your search.<br />
              It will do it's best to deliver the entire query as it is written in the search box.<br />
              Sometimes, you may want two words in your search to be equally scored in the search results.<br />
              This can be done using two tokens: AND, OR.<br />
              Use the terms like this:<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">availability OR notice</div><br />
              or<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">availability AND notice</div>
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Combining Advanced Search Syntax</strong><br />
              The search engine is capable of combining the tips above. You can do things like this:
              <div class="codeBlock">"notice of availability" OR "notice of appeal"</div><br />
              and<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">"notice of availability" AND "notice of appeal"</div><br />
              (which returns no results because it is too specific)
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Even More Syntax</strong><br />
              There are tons of other syntax items you can use.<br />
              Feel free to play around with any of the below.<br /><br />

              Parenthesis group items.<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">(notice OR availability) AND deposition</div><br />
              <br />

              Exclude terms from results with -, include terms with +<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">notice of +availability -deposition</div><br />
              In the above, "notice of" is optional, "availability" MUST be present. <br />
              "deposition" MUST not be in a result.<br />
              <br />

              Boost term relevance with ^#, like ^2 and ^3<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">notice^2 of availability^3 deposition</div><br />
              In the above, results with "availability" will be ranked highest.<br />
              Notice is ranked second highest. Deposition is unimportant in comparison.<br />
              <br />

              Allow literal searches to have terms inbetween<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">"notice of availability"</div> will NOT match "notice of the availability".<br />
              You can allow terms to occur between items in your literal search.<br />
              To do this, put ~# at the end of your quotes, where # is the fuzziness.<br />
              <div class="codeBlock">"notice of availability"~3</div><br />
              In the above, the engine will match results with a calculated distance of 3.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card" ng-if="searched && searchResults.length > 0" ng-repeat="result in searchResults">
          <div class="item item-text-wrap" ng-click="goTo(result._source.number)" ng-bind-html="result.highlight.content[0]"></div>
        </div>
    </ion-list>
  </ion-content>
